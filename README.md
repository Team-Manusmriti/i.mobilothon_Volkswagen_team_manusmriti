## VigilanceAI

VigilanceAI is an intelligent co-pilot engineered to redefine road safety by prioritizing the driver's overall well-being. Unlike conventional systems that react only when danger is imminent, VigilanceAI takes a proactive approach. It leverages multi-modal AI to integrate cabin video analytics—monitoring signs of drowsiness, stress, and medical distress—with real-time vehicle dynamics such as driving patterns and erratic behavior.

This enables a dual-layered support system:

- **Conversational AI Co-Pilot**: Offers real-time, context-aware assistance to manage everyday fatigue and stress. Whether it's suggesting alternate routes during traffic congestion or playing soothing music, it adapts to the driver's needs.
- **Emergency Event Detection System**: Goes beyond basic inactivity alerts to detect serious medical emergencies, collisions, or sudden loss of control. It automatically activates safety protocols to stabilize the vehicle and summon help.

VigilanceAI transforms driver assistance from passive monitoring to active care—serving as a trusted companion on every journey.
